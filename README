This thing is a tool to format Python code with Black and commit it to git in
one command, with the option to also push it. It does only this. Wildcards and
stuff works fine, and it differentiates between Python code and non-Python code
using file extensions and shebangs. Here are some examples of how it might be
used:

Single file:
    hose example.py
Multiple files:
    hose example.py example2.py
With wildcards:
    hose *
    hose *.py
With push:
    hose --push *
    hose -p *

Enjoy!
